Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                 2,240 out of  18,224   12%
    Number used as Flip Flops:               2,240
    Number used as Latches:                      0
    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  0
    Number used as AND/OR logics:                0
  Number of Slice LUTs:                      1,383 out of   9,112   15%
    Number used as logic:                    1,376 out of   9,112   15%
      Number using O6 output only:           1,289
      Number using O5 output only:              74
      Number using O5 and O6:                   13
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      7
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         6
      Number with other load:                    1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,268
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,029 out of   3,268   31%
    Number with an unused LUT:               1,885 out of   3,268   57%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         354 out of   3,268   10%
    Number of unique control sets:             261
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             272 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        24 out of     232   10%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                       24 out of      24  100%
    IOB Flip Flops:                             19
